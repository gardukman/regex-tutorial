# RegEx Tutorial by: Garrett Manwaring

In this tutorial, I'll explain what RegEx (Regular Expression) is and how it is used. I'll also provide a few examples of different RegEx code snippets and explain how and what they do. I'm no expert in RegEx, but I hope that my limited knowledge and explanations will help broaden your understanding on this coding language.

## Summary

A RegEx, or regular expression is basically a string of characters that help define a search parameter. Each character in the string is set to search for specific things within a larger string of characters. RegEx uses algorithms to find the patterns set in the search. The examples below are different expressions used in building regular expression search algorithms.
